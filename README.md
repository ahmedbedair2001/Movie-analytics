<h2>We have here a dataset of movies and our purpose here is to clean the data by a good way for ansering 4 questions and they are: </h2>
<ol>
<li> What is the most popular type of movie?</li>
<li> What kind of movies have the highest rating?</li>
<li> What is the most watched movie?</li>
<li> What is the year that most films have been produced?</li>
</ol>
<h2>So, We did some operations to clean the data from null values and prepare it to answer these questions so we did: </h2>
<ol>
<li> Dropping na values from columns </li>
<li> Using title column as index</li>
<li> visualized our data by using bar and horizontal bar to answer each question</li>
<li> printed the answer after each visualization</li>
</ol>
